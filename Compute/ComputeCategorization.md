+ **Virtual machines**
are **software emulations of physical computers**.
They include a virtual processor, memory, storage, and networking resources. They host an operating system (OS), and you're able to install and run software just like a physical computer. And by using a remote desktop client, you can use and control the virtual machine as if you were sitting in front of it. VM = *Virtualization of Hardware* .

+ **Containers**
are a virtualization environment for running applications. Just like virtual machines, containers are run on top of a host operating system but unlike VMs, they **don't include an operating system** for the apps running inside the container. Instead, containers bundle the libraries and components needed to run the application and use the existing host OS running the container. For example, if five containers are running on a server with a specific Linux kernel, all five containers and the apps within them **share that same Linux kernel**. Container = *Virtualization of OS*

+ **Azure App Service**
is a platform-as-a-service **(PaaS)** offering in Azure that is designed to host enterprise-grade **web-oriented applications**. You can meet rigorous performance, scalability, security, and compliance requirements while using a **fully managed platform** to perform infrastructure maintenance.

+ **Serverless Computing**
is a **cloud-hosted execution environment** that runs your code but completely abstracts the underlying hosting environment. You create an instance of the service, and you add your code; no infrastructure configuration or maintenance is required, or even allowed.
